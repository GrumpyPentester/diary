<h1>You don't want to work as a pentester</h1>

**Preface**: This is not meant to be an "elitism" post about how you must pass through a trial by fire in order to get a job as a penetration tester. It's just meant to highlight some of the areas that people tend to miss or overlook when deciding to get into this field.

**The wet dream**: So you want to work as a hacker huh? You like living and working in dark lit rooms, having 3 monitors with graphs, gauges, maps show your latest attacks and the constant humming of the cards that are either cracking passwords or mining the latest crypto? You want to be one of those people that with the click of a mouse access the most hidden forum boards that discuss the latest trends in hacking and cyber-crime? You also see yourself as this mysterious person that could gain access to anyone's account and cause havoc? People look at you in admiration and you attract people more than a rockstar? You watched Mr. Robot and are thinking to yourself: damn, that's exactly how I want my job to look like? It's time to WAKE THE FUCK UP!

I still remember a few years ago this "wannabe hacker" page on facebook ran by a guy that kept posting stuff like "never tell a girl you are a hacker" (questions on how I came across this page will be ignored). I have to say folks, the security field is one of the cringiest shows I ever witnessed. 

**The regular dream**: Most people that I've talked to that wanted to get into this field have this idyllic view of what a penetration tester actually does. 9 times out of 10, people usually think of "Red Team'' engagements. You know, those longer engagements - several weeks or months ideally - on which you have to be completely stealthy, not a lot of people know that you are attacking their assets and you sneak inside their virtual perimeter and plunder all that you can. While there is some truth into that, that's not what pentesting actually is. 

If you have no idea on how a penetration test is usually carried out, I will provide a very high overview of the process. A company (customer) goes out and hires another company to perform a penetration test (skipping the marketing steps). After signing a bunch of papers regarding scope of work, rules of engagement there is usually a kickoff call in which testers will take part, to discuss the details of the engagement, make sure that everything is ready and maybe get a demo of the application if it's a web engagement. The actual testing will take place after, and the pentester must deliver a report with the findings, a report that sometimes has to be presented to the client.

More likely than not, you will start your journey by doing web application testing (as web applications are the most commonly encountered nowadays). These are just one or two week engagements, and as a pentester you must cover all aspects of the application (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/">OWASP</a> is usually the "go-to" resource for that). After a period of time you will realise it is a somewhat cyclical task: you test input validation, access control, privilege escalation and all that fun stuff quickly turns into monotony. With the one or two weeks time frame that is usually allocated for this, the time for creative, out of the box thinking is really narrow. If you get a web application and must check it as a pentester, you have to cover all vectors that an attacker would take. Contrast this to let's say bug bounties, you could only specialise yourself in one kind of vulnerability and go through various programs just looking for that one issue. Of course, maybe you are lucky enough to start as a network tester; in my view this is somewhat more fun but I have to be honest, the chances are quite slim. Getting to that "red team" level will take you a long time, and you will have to be comfortable with a lot of aspects of testing.

**Elitism**: Not an elitism post as I was mentioning earlier. However, there are a lot of mofos out there that view themselves as kings of the world because they work in the infosec field. Calm down Mr. Mitnick Jr, not everyone is as highly educated as you are. Oh you don't know the OSI model bro? You clearly don't have a chance in becoming a penetration tester. There will be times when you will have to present your findings to people that think very highly of themselves and their products. Not everyone can handle being told that their babies are ugly, I know. It takes a bit of skill on how to frame these interactions. The best way I found so far is making the other part understand that you are not working against them but rather are there to help them (I know it's obvious, but sometimes it can be quite challenging to pull off). Sometimes in your team you can end up with such people as well, however, I was blessed to have great colleagues and was constantly surrounded by people that were willing to help. An advice: get rid of the assholes that are trying to put you down.


**Dealing with clients**: Somewhat tied to the previous point, but I cannot stress it enough, you will have to interact with a lot of people with different backgrounds. As a penetration tester, your final deliverable will be a report that will be handed to the client. In an ideal world, this report will be presented to a security team on the client side, or someone that is somewhat computer literate. Yes there is an "executive overview" part as well that provides a high level detail about the engagement and findings. Most of the times however, the client will ask for technical details about the findings. There will be times when they disagree with your ratings, there might be times where they try to justify why such behavior was present (oh do I have some stories for you - stay tuned). Also when setting up the penetration test, you can run into clients that have not performed such a test before, they have no idea of what it involves and maybe they are part of the "dreamers" team described above. Additionally, I can guarantee you that some pentests will go sideways - someone will go out of scope, someone will crash a service (I keep saying someone because of course that isn't me..). As a tester you must be prepared to deal with these scenarios. You won't be alone in this, and dealing with other people happens way more than you would think. Developing good social skills is a must if you want to excel in your work.

**Medusa head**: I don't know why this came into mind when thinking about the options that a penetration tester has. Maybe it is the resemblance that the amount of paths one could take in this field scares some people and turns them into stone. What I mean by this is that in the infosec field and also as a penetration tester you will have many paths to choose from. You can be a tester that just focuses on web applications, you can be one that focuses on internal network testing, or external or just wireless networks. Or maybe you fancy sitting all day in a debugger and developing custom exploits and 0days (that's not really a pentester if you ask me but more of a security researcher - definitely rustling some jimmies with this statement). When you are first starting out I encourage you to try different aspects and see which one you like the most. Once you find that, try to stick to it for a while. Trying to become good at all of them at the same time is quite tricky. Not impossible, if you think you can do it, sure, go ahead. I'm just saying what worked for me and for others around me. One aspect that is important is to accept that you will not know everything. Do you have to be "the best'' in all possible aspects of a penetration test? No, of course not. There are people that are really good on web stuff, even deeper, there are people that are really good just on certain aspects of web penetration testing (such as sql injection gurus). Not encouraging mediocrity, I am just saying it's ok to not be an expert on all branches.

**Keeping up with trends**: Although most issues that were present 20 years ago are still around to this day (such as default credentials), there are a lot of technologies that are constantly coming out and you must be on top of them. You don't need to be a master in each one of them, but knowing their quirks, knowing similarities with other products and such will help. For example, not a lot of emphasis was put on Active Directory 10 years ago as everyone was using other solutions. Nowadays most companies will use it so knowing how to get around in such environments and knowing the attacks that are specific to it is mandatory if you want to provide a good value to your customers. This needs a lot of time which you will have to invest yourself in learning new things, keeping up with the latest exploits and attacks. And guess what... It will come out of your "own pocket". If you are working as a penetration tester, chances are that you won't get time off just for "studying". You will however, get some time to take part in training offered by various companies out there. Does that suffice? To be honest, not really.

**Mental health**: Look, like any other job, this takes a toll on your mental health. Don't think to yourself it will be a breeze; yeah you most likely will have some advantages like job flexibility regarding hours and location. But trust me that all negative aspects do pile up and you will need some breathing room (you can start a Diary and vent there).


**Key takeaways**:
- Do you really want to work as a pentester or do you just like messing around with software? maybe bug bounty is more down your lane
- A pentester's job is nothing like what you see in the movies or what you think of before actually joining the field.
- Are you ready to deal with customers?
- Are you ok with constantly learning new things?
- If you know you are ok with all the above, I do encourage you to join us. The security field is greatly understaffed...

**And my 2 cents**: It is absolutely astonishing to me how companies managed to take these people that are innately "rebellious", quite curious creatures, and turn them into "9-5" workers. To that, I tip my fedora! Also, if you are working as a pentester, don't forget to complete your annual internal corporate training!
