Oh look, it's almost the end of the year again. After using all the funds and ticking all the checkboxes for their Top 1000-whatever company, the board looks at the last thing on the list. Way past new furniture, new pointless internal software that only makes a regular worker's life even more tedious, that last item stares back at them: **the annual penetration test**. Oh, the dreaded security test. You know that test that will tell them how safe their products are. Previously working into regular software testing, I was always amazed how late into the development process software testing was getting involved. You would see on a regular basis software changes that were deployed to production environments with ZERO testing from the "QA" team. I was always a bit shocked and frustrated with this approach. So I moved into security testing.. and I have to say "holy fk!!". 

Look people, most companies do not care about the safety of your online data. I know, what a shocker! They care about their own financial well being. And yes, arguably a security breach will affect their image and because of that they will lose funds. It's time for people to understand that (almost) every company is out there to make money. That is their focus. Let's not beat around the bush,I know, you want to make the internet a safer place, you want to create a new technology that will make people's lives easier and all that pink fluffy stuff. The truth however, is that without the proper **$$$**, no company can survive. Therefore, when it comes to security, the biggest concern that companies have is to not lose funds. They don't care about your credentials getting leaked, your account getting targeted by some cross-site scripting issue, if it doesn't trigger a money loss on their side, it won't really matter. And yes, I know there are domains (such as hospitals where you deal with PII) where you have the impression that your data is the most guarded asset. This is mainly because of the regulations that are in place; apps dealing with massive PII that have a security breach will find themselves in a whole lot of trouble because of regulations. But I digress...

November and December are the months where these companies wake up from their hibernation and try to tick off the annual pentest on their list. And they want it done ASAP!!! I am always amazed by these companies during kick-off calls that have a long list of "demands" that they want for their test, but come with this attitude of "yeah, we sort of postponed it for too long,we are sorry". Well guess what, a TON of other parties are in the same boat and you will just have to do with the little amount of effort that will be available to be put into your test. 

For companies that provide penetration testing services, it's the period when everything goes up in flames. Torches get lit, vacation requests get denied, schedules get crammed. And of course as a tester, if you need help from the product side, getting in touch with someone during the Holiday season will be an almost impossible task because guess what? They left you (the tester) out there to do your thing while everyone else on their side went on vacation. Why was I saying earlier that the amount of work will be little? Because of the simple clusterfk that happens during these months. As you know (or don't) a tester's daily schedule won't be only looking into your engagement. There are other kick-off calls that must happen, debrief calls, reports that get moved back and forth between the QA team, retests, answering to random requests from everyone and so on. So when you get your test in the two months that are crammed as much as possible, do you really think that the end result will be pristine? Add to that the usual job burnout, and I'm telling you that the quality of an engagement is drastically reduced if you run it at the end of the year.

And then you get to actual testing.. I have to say, the software which I came across during the months of December or November is some of the poorest designed. I'm not saying all of them are that way (because I've also come across some that looked actually solid) but for some I was really tempted to ask the client for the source code as it would have made for great testing practice. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/">Juiceshop</a> is actually safe when compared to some of the web application pentests that are encountered during these months. They show a clear lack of a security mindset within the software design. And it's not things that are quickly resolved by changing some configs (such as cookie flags). No, sometimes it's stuff that must be burned to the ground and rebuilt. A complete lack of access control measures, permissions being enforced just through "obscure" paths within the application, data that is created through GET requests and the list goes on. And the best part, these are already out in production.

What can we do? Well as a tester, these things are inevitable. You just have to lock yourself tight during this period, take care of your mental health and not get too annoyed about these events. It has somewhat become the norm. Do your best - because that's what the engagement will actually be at the end of the day: a best effort approach. For companies, the thing that you can do is realise that postponing the inevitable is not a viable solution. And at the end of the day, it costs you more to address an issue that is already buried deep down into the code base which will need a lot of time and resources to address.

**Key takeaways**:
- don't think that software companies care too much about your own personal data's security
- when developing software, for the love of God, get someone from the security team involved in the project as early as possible (what do you mean you don't have a security team???)
- the pentests are anual, WAKE UP and don't postpone them to December every year - if you don't care about your pentest, neither will the tester

For all you companies out there that take security seriously and are always on top of things when it comes to penetration testing - a big thank you from TheGrumpyPentester <3
